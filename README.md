I like to keep my build simple as possible, thats why it doesn't have too many patches.

List of patches applied:
- [centeredwindowname](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/centeredwindowname/dwm-centeredwindowname-20200723-f035e1e.diff)
- [fullgaps](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fullgaps/dwm-fullgaps-20200508-7b77734.diff)

I run a custom build of dwmblocks displaying the current brightness, time and date. Wifi and sound is handled in the systray patch with nm-applet and pasystray.
